I will never fly with WestJet again, I will never fly Swoop, and I will never recommend this airline to anyone - professionally or personally.

We arrived at the Toronto airport 3 hours prior to our flight as required by the airline for international departures. We were on a direct flight heading to Las Vegas. We had a few people ahead of us and there were four reps at the check-in counters when we arrived. We waited in line for over 1 hour as the Swoop check-in reps called people heading to 3 other destinations, Montego, Halifax, Kalona, ahead of us as apparently their flights were on last calls. Why there weren't separate lines set up for these 4 flights, how could there be so many people, and all 3 flights where on last call was beyond everyone's understanding who were there on time for the Vegas flight. Instead people who decided it wasn't important to be at the airport on time for their flight where called ahead of those who followed the rules and to add insult to injury we had to wait longer in line because we followed the rules. To make it even better, it was at this point that the check-in reps decided it was time to leave and we were down to one rep for a significant amount of time while the line kept growing behind us. So what this tells us is that the airline has no consideration or respect for customers who comply with their regulations. Truthfully you're further ahead to not inconvenience yourself show up whenever you want, you'll be treated better. The final topper was when our luggage was finally checked-in we had to haul it all the way down to US customs at the other end of the airport. Nice! Thanks Swoop! FYI, we will never fly with Swoop again and don't recommend it either, unless of course you're one of those entitled stragglers that feels the world revolves around you, then Swoop is the perfect airline for you.

We started our vacation on 13 Mar 2023 flight WO0638 to Cancun. We waited after we boarded more than one hour on board without knowing why we don't take off. It is true that the captain made an announcement , but in so low voice that was hard to understand. Asking the flight attendant why we don't proceed to take off she was annoyed, I guess, and said that the captain already mentioned that. I did not understand neither did my wife. Finally we got to Cancun late more than one hour but they ran out of Mexican immigration forms and we had to figure it out at our time expense, adding more time to be late in the resort. No complimentary anything was handed to us to compensate a bit all of this inconvenience. Now comes the part when we return from Cancun, 18 Mar 2023. Getting to the airport we noticed that our flight 641 has been delayed for more than 5 hours let alone the line up time for checking in. Please note that no email has been sent to us to let us know the flight is delayed. Then when we've got to the check in counter and we started to ask questions one of clerks took us on a side and issued us vouchers for the 3 of us worth 60$. and we were told to check in around 21:00 since the flight was delayed till after midnight. But no plausible explanation has been given to us. Checked out the hotel at noon, got to the airport around 16:00 the flight was at 20 minutes past midnight so more than 12 hours wasted because some clerk in Canada did not do its due diligence to send out an email.

It is impossible to contact Swoop to speak to a representative. My daughter bought a Swoop ticket from Toronto to Victoria for a reasonable price. She was flying out for our family reunion and her sisters milestone 50th birthday and was coming 4 days early to help us with all the plans. The day before she was to leave, Swoop cancelled, ""Due to Unscheduled Maintenance"", without the courtesy of a 24 hour notice. (Swoop sent a second email stating the reason for the cancellation was incorrect and then gave a second reason for the cancellation!) The flights Swoop offered to re-book were all a minimum of 9 1/2 hours as opposed to her original 5 hour direct flight. Swoop said she would also have to pay the fare difference at this very late notice. The only flight she could get to Victoria to make it on time for the family reunion, arrived late afternoon, on the day of the family gathering. She arrived here at 2:30 pm. As a result we had to scramble to do all the event planning which our daughter was going to take care of. My husband just had a knee replacement and I am working in my older years so this is a huge inconvenience and disruption for all of us. After the stress and disappointment, if you can imagine this, there was a second cancellation at 4pm Saturday. She was to leave at 8:00am the next morning with no possibility to re-book. In order to get to Victoria on Sunday, the day of the family celebration, she had to book a one way ticket with Air Canada and Lynx Air from Toronto to Victoria with a 2 1/2 hour stop over in Calgary for $800. The original Swoop flight was listed at $120. My daughter investigated her cancelled flight and discovered the Swoop flight was not cancelled but was ""fully booked"" (see screen shot). We believe that Swoop bumped her lower fare ticket in order to accommodate later higher priced tickets. This poor treatment has happened to many people.

We just kept searching for hours for anyone to help us. There were no announcements made about the cancellation either. We all found out through email. After many hours, we were let out of the airport and had to find places to stay, pay for them (with no compensation at all from Swoop), and told that they would email us when our rescheduled flight would be. We eventually got rescheduled for 9AM the next day and ended up actually departing around 10:30 AM. Once we arrived in Canada, there was a delay for the plane to arrive to the gate and our luggage was extremely delayed. Again, there were no swoop representatives to help us. No announcements were made about the luggage either. Almost 2 hours after landing, I finally was able to find my bag. I have since reached out to Swoop through their FB 'customer service'. They have told me that there will be no compensation through them because they said the cancellation was uncontrollable, but in reality, we were told that the airline couldn't leave because when they arrived in Jamaica, the crew was over their time. This is so unacceptable and ridiculous. You also have to pay separately for your bags and if you want any food or drinks on the plane.

Swoop had an early afternoon flight (as did AC and WestJet, but we wouldn't be able to sit together). We booked it with extras - checked & cabin baggage, priority boarding. When the agent took our bags only then were we advised that the flight was delayed several hours. Although it was about 2 hours before the flight was originally scheduled to depart Vegas, the inbound aircraft had not even yet left Toronto. The departure was ultimately put off to 5:30 pm and we were each given a $10 meal voucher for our trouble. My originally booked flight, which I had to cancel, departed on time at 5:05. (Flair). When the aircraft arrived at the gate, the boarding process began with our zone 1. We passed through boarding pass scanning, and were met with a long line of people waiting to board in the jetway. We were towards the back of the line, near the entrance to the jetway. We waited there about 15 - 20 minutes before some people in hi-vis jackets passed by us and then quickly came out to abruptly tell us the flight was cancelled. We immediately re-booked on the later, red-eye AC Rouge flight 1704 (which was excellent and on-time, by the way). We had to be in Buffalo by 11am on Saturday. That red-eye was our last chance to meet that deadline. Swoop later emailed us with a link to book an overnight room and rebooked our flight to the next morning, Saturday Nov. 12, at 10am. It ultimately left late, at 11:50 am, arriving in Toronto at 6:30 pm, about 24 hours later than originally scheduled. Do not fly this airline.

It has now been well over 72 hours with no communication whatsoever from the airline in response to our many inquiries, and no real way to reach them. You are better off walking. Although Swoop said that the delay was somehow due to customs & immigration delays (even though the passengers on the inbound flight YYZ - LAS would have all precleared US customs in Toronto), I suspect that the real issue was that the delay had taken the crew out of its allowed time for service, and they had a mandatory rest period before the flight could resume on its way back to Toronto. Why do I think so? Because I sure didn't see any new crew show up and I was at that gate literally from 11:30 am - 5:30pm.

We landed I had less than 1 hour to switch luggage because Edmonton was unable to. The swoop check in bag person just looked at me said nothing I can do.

We were planning to go to Kingston for a reunion and return by Air Canada October 20 as that was the flight available so I could get back to work the following day. Our booking involved a rental car, a hotel and a return flight. The outgoing Swoop flight had been changed to two hours later than the original flight, we endured 90 minutes of line ups, stressing us about missing the flight, only to find out the incoming plane would not land due to wind so went to Vancouver instead. No other airline had this problem. They kept us on hold until for another 3 hours whereupon they canceled the flight and rebooked us for the next day. Unfortunately, that would get us to Kingston too late to get to much of what we were going for so we decided to cancel the trip as it seemed we would be spending most of it on a plane. We were able to cancel with Air Canada for the return, the hotel, and the car rental without much problem and get refunds or credits, but not with Swoop the cause of the problem! Furthermore we were unable to contact Swoop at all to cancel, so I had to physically return to the check in at the airport the next day to cancel with the check in agent. Stunningly, Swoop would offer no compensation, unlike all the other providers who had no part in causing this problem! I think that aside from extremely poor business practices this is a sign of a company in financial trouble that is soon to declare bankruptcy as they clearly do not care about PR.

Also our return flight was delayed. I was traveling for business while my family was tagging along for a vacation. I thought this would be low cost option however by the time you pay for all the fees (don't forget to pay for your seat selection so your aren't separated from your child - as stated right on their booking website?!?!) and ALL baggage - carry on included, it works out to be the same or more than flying with a real airline. Lesson learned however it meant getting the times required so I figured lesson learned. Next I paid for Swoop's extra baggage & cancellation insurance (provided by CHUBB Insurance Brokers) just in case. Prior to leaving our one family member fell ill and was subsequently diagnosed with lung cancer. To accommodate specialist appointments our travel dates changed and the affected family member was no longer going to join the trip - I couldn't simply modify the booking but was advised by the customer service department for the CHUBB Insurance (Swoop's bot directed me here) to rebook the flights for the new dates & submit for reimbursement to their claims department after we returned. However, you cannot simply book for only those going but rather for the entire party even when 1 passenger is no longer going on the trip. At flight check in time, we had to advise the boarding desk of the 1 passenger not joining (should be a simple task) however take off was still delayed both ways as the check in desk didn't inform the flight crew so they were trying to track down the missing passenger. All on board purchases were very expensive & must be paid for by credit card. The plane itself was very small & seats felt cheap & uncomfortable. The onboard wifi was choppy and kept cutting out and the cabin crew were very rude. On return departure a ground crew member was complaining loud enough that us other passengers could hear how annoyed they were at having to help a passenger onto the plane that was in a wheelchair! I have flown other budget airlines before and found their service & planes much better. So since nothing (flight change fee, new flights for all 4 passengers even though only 3 were traveling, additional insurance) was reimbursed even though I paid extra for this optional insurance, I am now out $3348.17 plus the costs of the multiple physician notes the insurance adjusters kept requiring (had to send in 4 different notes over the course of the 8 week claim battle).

We are travelling from Victoria to Toronto and chose Swoop because the airfare seemed to be a good price. However, once you purchase your ticket you find out that a carry on bag is not included, we were travelling with a family of 3 and had to pay an additional $300 approx. to bring a carry on! Not checked bag. This defeated the point of purchasing with Swoop. They cancelled our flight less than 24 hours before take off due to unscheduled maintenance. the only options were to select a Westjet flight that didn’t leave anywhere near the same time. Our original flight was scheduled to leave at 9:50AM and arrive in Toronto at 5:30 PM… the earliest flight offered was leaving Victoria at 6:40 PM, arriving in Toronto the next day at 6:00 Am. Our original flight was direct, the replacement had a stop with 3 hour layover. Arriving to our destination a day later caused us to have to reschedule our car rental, our hotel which we are out of pocket $ We have one less day for our family holiday and the inconvenience to have to reschedule the entire week with our extended family. My time is valuable and I had scheduled my time off work where now I have lost wages for a day I could have been working. To add to it, you can’t get ahold of any customer service agents. They have a messenger service which response was that an agent would get back to me in 72 hours.

The choice of food for a 4 hour flight could have been much better but we were prepared and had eaten before our flight.

This time was different though, I had my one year old daughter with me. What started out as Swoop airlines telling me I was at the wrong gate - turned into over $1400+ in expenses and damages in just a few hours. As I approached gate B5 at Toronto Pearson airport which was stated on my ticket where my flight would be - the service staff informed me that I was infact flying out of B25 instead. So, from there I pretty much ran pushing my daughter in the stroller approximately 15 mins across the airport. Once I reached B25 I was informed there that the flight I was trying to catch had already left. From there, I back tracked. Racing both my daughter and I back to B5. And what happens when I reach B5? I am denied boarding. They told me they called my name so many times that I can no longer board, I've missed my chance, as I watch the plane preparing to leave the gate. Keep in mind, my reason for flying is because I am relocating from Ontario to Saskatchewan. I have no family left and not many friends in Ontario. I am flying to Edmonton to meet my family. With my one year old daughter. I begin panicking, as someone who does infact suffer from major anxiety, I'm being told I can't catch my flight. At this point I'm told to sit down and they will help me. I'm crying uncontrollably when the supervisor approaches me. Telling me infront of the rest of the people waiting for other flights to ""get it together"" and ""what example I am setting for my daughter"" So now I'm being shamed by someone who has no compassion that a young mother who has been denied access to fly to my new home is over reacting? I'm sorry but if you were told to get it together and go home with nowhere to go how would you react? At this point some stranger came over to me and tried to calm me down. I couldn't stop crying and began having a panic attack. This went on for over an hour before they told me to go home and that they can do nothing for me. Not only blaming me for missing a flight I was prepared and waiting for but shaming me, calling me names and being far from decent. There was no compassion for someone who was told to go else where and then sent back to where I was originally was just for them to tell me that it was my fault? Telling me to go home but where do I go? No car, no house, no family. Just me and my daughter at this point it was midnight and I was left alone at the gate. The only person who showed me any decency was the security guards who helped me find my way out of the airport and over to the connecting hotel. The Sheraton. How is it fair that I had to check in to a hotel at 1am with my baby and be charged $545 for a single room from the hours of 130am until check out which was 11am that same morning?

When this happens, they give you the option to accept the changes, make your own changes or cancel and receive a refund in the form of the original payment. I contacted them on social media asking if I could receive a full refund to my credit card and they said no. Since this flight was booked using mostly credits, I could only receive another credit to my account but I would receive the additional money I spent(since the flights for more expensive than our original booking) on my credit card. I fought with them a bit on this because I don't really want credit towards an airline I never intend to use again due to the complete uncertainty of the flights themselves but the answer was still no. They put the onus completely on the passenger to change their whole schedule around every single little change they make. They make it incredibly difficult to make your own changes but they are allowed to make several unreasonable changes. Not everybody can just add 2 extra days to their vacation no problem or just fly out of a completely different airport. And it's not like they offered to pay for any additional costs this would incur for accomodations, car rentals or travelling to & from the airport. They trap you and then pretend like they offered you a reasonable solution. If you are a person who is okay with last minute changes and can afford to be loosey-goosey with your dates, times and airports, maybe Swoop is the right airline for you but in my opinion, they are a terrible option for the average person.",0,0,swoop,terrible option for the average person,Couple Leisure,Trip Verified,1,0,48c26ffe-8953-4819-a349-504a9f7ef737,Embraer,Toronto,Abbotsford,0,0,0

Check in staff are always extremely rude and unhelpful. They nickel and dime you everywhere. Checked bags are super expensive, no complimentary beverages other than water, it’s just bottom of the barrel service. This time around I had a 6.30am flight to Florida and arrived at the airport at 4.30am having previously “checked in” online the day before. However, they wouldn’t send any digital boarding passes so despite having checked in, I still had to go to the kiosk to get my boarding pass. That line took over an hour because Swoop had 3 other Florida flights at 6.30 and only 5 staff members checking in. Swoops disorganization led to a massive back up in the entire terminal and it took over 3 hours to get through baggage drop, security and customs. Because there were so many flights rushing to make their 6.30am departure, no one was allowed to skip ahead in the lines. Needless to say, my flight was supposed to depart at 6.30am, I walked onto the flight at 7.10am and I am currently writing this review at 8.00am and we’re still waiting for passengers to board. They held the flight, but this extreme delay was entirely the fault of Swoop and their outdated and understaffed system process. Also amongst the kiosk line a baby had dropped their bottle and a giant milk spill was on the floor for a while. I remembered it was there on my way to the desk, but after getting my boarding pass I was in a frantic rush and forgot. So I sped walk straight through it and slipped and landed directly on my back in the middle of the puddle. Disgusting. It had been there over half an hour and because it was all chaos no swoop employees signalled for it to be cleaned up. Now I’m on a cramped flight with an extremely sore back.

For my family, this meant waking up at 5am with little kids the third day instead of arriving at the airport at 8pm. We drove 4 hours to the destination so shortening the trip by a day is really a frustrating and costly option. Then, as you try to navigate the new flight option another flight appears the next morning, ten hours after the cancelled flight (which would of worked fine) but it isn't an option in the email they sent with instructions. Only after waiting for 3 hours on hold (but never talking to anyone) and chatting online do you find out you should of booked that new flight on your own dollar and then they would of refunded you fully. The flight was sold out by that time so isn't an option. The only two options are to take a day off a three day trip or board the next available flight which is literally three days after the original. There isn't an option to be refunded, moved to flight within days of your original or to take a credit. They don't actually ever answer the phone and it's a computer messaging system until you navigate through that. Once you get a real person they just become a broken record typing canned responses.

When I booked the flight, the additional cost for a carry-on was something like $45, but, since I've travelled with this backpack on Swoop many times before, I knew I'd be fine with declining the fee for a carry-on. When I checked in at the airport the morning of my flight, the Swoop employee had me place my bag in this measurement tool - which was highly problematic and arbitrary because my pack was slightly too large one way but considerably smaller than required in another way. The guy charged me $69 for it. A little later I passed by another customer who had been behind me in the check-in line who had a much bigger pack than me. He told me that he wasn't even asked to place his pack in the measurement tool, let alone charged for his pack. He let me take a photo of his pack so I could go back and show the employee to try and get my money back. Well that didn't work. He told me to try the customer service number if I wanted a refund. A few days later, after waiting on hold for over an hour, I got through to customer service and explained the situation. They said that the employees have discretion to ask some customers to measure their packs but not others. So for some arbitrary reason I had to pay $69 for my backpack which they've considered a personal item 3 times before, because they deemed it a carry-on, even though the total volume of the measurement tool was larger than my pack (my pack was only too large in one dimension, smaller in others) and other customers with larger packs didn't have to pay anything.

When you speak to them on their website or any social media platform, you get a bot and never a person (this is by design). Why is this by design? I had no choice but to dispute the charges for the flights on my credit card through my flight cancellation insurance. I was denied any refund even at the credit card level. Why? Because, I could not show that I tried to cancel, even though I spent 4 hours that day in total trying to get in touch with them, right up until the moment my flight was to depart. They will tell your credit card company that you didn't show up so they can keep your money and leave you with no recourse. I was advised by my credit card company to contact the better business bureau to fight and try to get them charged to return my $800, but you and I both know this won't happen. This company is completely built, from the ground up, to offer no customer service of any kind. They have a fine print terms and conditions that was written very specifically to shield them from ever having to give a refund, and no matter how extreme your case, even with extreme medical complications and prior notice, they will refuse outright to even speak to you, let alone make arrangements to help you in any way, shape or form. I will not be in a financial hardship from this, but I know many many people who would be devastated to lose this much money. It is not fair, and they shouldn't get away with it.

I was hesitant to book Swoop based on the plethora of bad reviews but the price was just too good to pass up. I had only flew with Swoop once before on a solo two-day trip to Toronto that went without a hitch. Booking: Fully-online. No trouble. Seat selection: Paid for 4 seats up-front as a kids was free to select a seat for if an adult paid for a seat. Not too shabby. Bag Charge: Paid for one checked bag up front to save costs at the Airport. Weighed in at 48 pounds. Checked bags: Did not bring checked bags due to cost. Personal items: Kids brought mini-back-backs that held small electronics, snacks, a water bottle. All within specs. No issues. I brought a laptop case that also fit snacks and water. No issue. Wife brought large purse with no issue. Just don't expect to pack clothes to avoid the check-in bag charge and you will be alright. Post-booking: Swoop up and changes out return date from Tuesday to Monday. Given that we were departing on the Saturday, this cut the by a 1/3 if accepted. I did not accept and changed the flights to arrive and depart a day earlier resulting in the same length of stay. Did this on-line with no issues and no additional fees for either the change itself or cost of the new dates as the original cost of both those dates was $150 more than the dates we originally picked. Swoop absorbed the cost on-line due to the cancellation of one of the return flight date. Issues post re-booking: The paid checked bag moved over to the new flights but the seat assignments and the fact we paid did not. No ability to select seats on-line without paying the same fee over again. Called the call center number, put the phone on the desk while I did other things on the computer and was connected after 105 minutes. The call center agent was able to book the 4 of us together at no charge based on the fact we had originally paid for the tickets. A bit of a hassle but we were getting a better itinerary dates than the one we originally purchased so I took the good with the bad. Check-in: Checked in on-line and downloaded digital boarding passes. That did not take care of still needing to check in the checked bag so we arrived 60 minutes before the check-in closed to drop off the bag. Bad check-in took 4 minutes. Same experience on the return flight. No wait for agent to weigh and check in our suitcase. Flight: No issues. Staff were friendly. We brought snacks and water from the departure area stores before boarding. No issues with that. Bought a rum and I asked for two cups with ice and a full can of coke which they happily provided. Toasted by wife on what was an excellent vacation.  Despite the cancellation of the return flight date (they cancelled all Tuesday flights from Edmonton to Victoria for the next year which meant we were not a one-off) everything else went as expected. Same thing could have happened with any other airline so we did play the victim card and had an excellent trip. The only word of advice I would give is to book refundable hotels in case this type of cancellation happens. We booked our hotels using air miles so lost a night at the end.

I had to cancel my flight within the 24 hour window on October 5th due to illness and had to get a COVID-19 test. I was told my flight could be rescheduled. Under the impression my flight was successfully cancelled I was instructed to call back to reschedule the next day when I knew a return date. That very same day, my father had a stroke. I was actually visiting him because he had a heart attack just 2 weeks prior. Needless to say he was in the hospital and this was a scary time where I was far more preoccupied with my parents and making sure my father was going to be ok. A few days after that, I get the news that the man I love and was supposed to spend my life with passed away suddenly. I don't think further explanation is needed for just how taxing what I have been experiencing is on one's mental and physical health, let alone finances. My week long visit turned into one month and it's quite evident why calling Swoop back was not a top priority. I put a request in for an agent to contact me days ago and never heard from anyone. I called today and was on hold for around an hour. The agent I finally connected with, despite my specific circumstances around my return, was purely focused on the fact that the last agent who was supposed help me with my flight conveniently did not ""cancel"" my flight or take any notes that mention the word cancel. Meaning she could not credit me for a flight that was not cancelled and was unwilling to consider any other way of assisting me. Life happens, and being a budget airline I thought that they may understand the gravity finances have on people's lives.

She didn’t say a word after that, except “no refunds”. I wasn’t offered any sort of assistance to get the bag added to a later flight or check a smaller sized bag as a carry on. Called customer support after my flight and they said that since there are no refunds period, that I can’t even have the bag accredited for a future flight and couldn’t have offered to have it brought on another flight.

Closer to my flight, I got in touch with my family doctor to express my concern about travelling from Ontario to the red zone that Edmonton was in at the time and he advised against my travels due to my respiratory issues. So I emailed Swoop customer service on December 13th letting them that I didn't feel comfortable traveling and I would like the option to get a credit for my flight on file - they suggested that I move my dates. Unfortunately, I didn't know when it would be safe for me to travel again as I had a medical note from my doctor advising against my travel for the time being. Swoop said that they cannot do anything about this and that I had to proceed with my flight or change the dates - I tried to change my dates but I had to pay 2.5x more on top of my initial flight cost to move dates to a date that I was pulling from thin air. I then sent my doctors note to the customer service agents, 72 hours before my flight, asking again for credit to be able to travel with Swoop again and I did not receive a response. I followed up again at 48 hours and again at 24 hours prior and no response - until finally I sent a lengthy email outright threatening that I would file this complaint if I didn't hear back from them to which they replied saying that their policies were the cornerstone of their operation and that I should have informed them 72 hours in advance of my flight. I mentioned to the agent that I travel often for business and to visit my family so this would not be the last of my travels, hoping a loyalty clause in their policies would apply, but again I did not receive any communication.

I also like how this airline doesn’t allow people to jump around to free open seats without paying and how they don’t offer complimentary menu items.

Talked to a few people waiting in line and on the plane who said they fly Swoop often and that they have never had issues. Flight to Edmonton had absolutely no issues. Seats are actually a decent size and my plane had chargers at each seat, which was fantastic ( I am used to flying Frontier, which is tiny seats, tiny trays, and no charging ability). Staff were very nice and did a great job. We did have delays on the return to Hamilton, but Swoop sent emails quite a bit in advance ( like 2-3 hours) and explained the issue when we got on the plane. We were supposed to fly out at 9:50AM and we didn't end up leaving until 1PM, so not ideal, but I went into flying with Swoop knowing that could be an issue (based on what I had heard and read from others). But again - staff were very nice, understanding, and made the entire flight enjoyable. I'd absolutely recommend Swoop for a cheap weekend trip.

106639,Swoop,Economy Class,2019-12-31,2019-10-05,0,0,1,Canada,1.0,no,"Abbotsford to Hamilton. Yesterday evening, after nine hours of travel (air and land) from Queen Charlotte BC in Haida Gwaii to Abbotsford I was denied boarding for my flight to Hamilton. The reason for denial was having incorrect identification according to company policy, but I feel that the issue was addressed with little respect and understanding of the situation and the lack of willingness to cooperatively address the issue will result in me missing my brother's wedding tomorrow. Earlier this week I lost my wallet with my passport in it, leaving me with no photo identification, living on a small island with no access to apply for an emergency passport or other government identification. From a Service BC satellite office, I acquired an interim driver's license and interim BC Services Card (Care Card). Prior to my travel, I checked the Transport Canada regulations and found that for domestic travel 2 pieces of valid (not-expired) government issued identification were acceptable so long as they had the name that matched the ticket, birth date and gender. It also mentioned in the case of a driver's license having the expired license as accompanying photo ID. I had all these pieces, although my expired driver's license was for an Ontario license rather than my interim BC license (which is just the reality of me moving from Ontario to BC within the past few years). I figured I had all the necessary documents to travel. I did a quick scan of Air Canada and Swoop policies and noted they mirrored Transport Canada policies. I was able to board my Air Canada flight from Sandspit to Vancouver with the documentation I had on hand. I then traveled 2 hours from YVR to YXX on public transit and was denied boarding for my 9:55pm flight. The reasons provided to me were as follows: - Because my expired license is from a different issuing agency than my interim license, it was not considered valid as a primary or secondary piece of ID - Swoop accepts ""Care Cards"", but the customer service representative said that ""BC Services Cards"" are not the same. BC only issues Service Cards now, so the paperwork I had was as close to a Care Card as I was going to get. The other ID I had on hand included a fishing license (accepted until very recently), several student cards (which I recognize are not government issued), photocopy of my passport, and an expired government-issued residency card. I was told that there was no grace period for accepting the fishing license, although the Transport Canada policy change is still in its grace period. When I was denied I respectfully accepted that I did not have what was required, but asked if I could switch to the flight the next day... I would have my friends send down my birth certificate and any other documentation today (Oct 4) to board the 9:55pm flight. I also asked if he could help me identify what ID I would need if I rebooked the flight. The agent said he did not have time to help with re-booking and told me to call Swoop (the offices were closed at that time). I asked if his team lead could help me, he went to ask her, but came back saying she was too busy to talk to me. This morning I called the Swoop office. The woman I spoke to was very sympathetic and said if I was able to get proper ID she could book me on this evening's flight and offered to ask her supervisor if they could give me a voucher towards the price of the flight (which had gone up to over $450 one way).",0,0,swoop,denied boarding for my flight,Solo Leisure,Trip Verified,1,0,19e26bca-80de-4345-842a-8efb586a1983,Boeing,Abbotsford,Hamilton,1,0,0

They do not come up with solutions, their reps are extremely robotic on the phone and they strictly stick to their policies. So avoid making any mistakes or changes, or you will run into this issue, and it's the biggest pain. On a lighter note, Swoop is great for lower price flights. You pay for your base cost flight, then you pay for your seats, baggage, and any thing extra. So you get to control what you want and how much you want to ideally pay for for a flight altogether. The plane itself is comparable to Westjet's comfort, especially the Emergency Exit seats. Those are my go-to seats, I'm not sure about the front row but so far the Emergency Exit Seats are my favourite. I highly recommend for trips that are longer than 2 hours, or if you happen to be on the heavier side, no shame.  Swoop does not have free wifi or inflight entertainment, so make sure you have your own music/videos/movies downloaded beforehand.

I booked a Swoop flight from Edmonton to Las Vegas last weekend, they delayed our departure by over 1.5 hours with no apologies.

No charges to leave Edmonton. I tried to check in online on my way back and it was not allowed. So I showed up 2 hours early at the gate just to find out the the same half size carry on was not allowed and needed to pay $57.75 US dollars to also carry on myself.

I called in and waited an hour to cancel my flight as you cannot cancel partial reservations online.

This is idiotic but I said fine can she book my flight for me using that credit and she can't. It can only be used for when she herself is flying. This is absolutely ridiculous, nowhere on the site does it say this. If I am cancelling my flight why would the credit only be usable to her.

I am in the military and have a contract that requires me to be on base NLT Monday. That gave me two full days to pack and prepare after my trip. Had it been a couple hour delay it would have been fine. So I went to the airport to find alternate arrangements. But there were no swoop agents at the airport to talk to. I called the number on the website and it mentioned paying $15 just for the convenience of calling rather than writing in. I was on hold for over an hour and no one picked up. So I had to find alternate arrangements on my own. I ended up having to pay $660 as that was the only option and it was the least seat. The sign for swoop changed from delayed to cancelled. There has been zero compensation for the flight, for the new flight, or for the ticket I purchased to go to the comic con which I had to miss since the new flight was much earlier and I had already bought tickets. Then I had a half hour window to drive around Vegas to drop off my rental car and get back to the airport which was approximately a fifteen minute ride away plus two shuttles to get to the terminal 3. I am not impressed and highly recomend against Swoop. I'm lucky enough to have got a flight out.

I will begin by saying that flying out of Hamilton was a much more relaxing experience than flying out of Toronto. Both legs arrived relatively on time (with about a 15-20 minute delay). Boarding was speedy and efficient in both instances and the overall experience was more than acceptable. My only gripe with Swoop is their luggage policy. I have flown with other Ultra low cost carriers in Europe (Pegasus, Ryanair, EasyJet) and never had I dealt with the type of scrutiny that these guys place on luggage. I was flying down with just a personal item on both legs. Leaving Hamilton, it was clear that my medium sized backpack fit comfortably under the seat (even though in all fairness when I tried to get it to fit in their ""luggage size testers"" it was virtually impossible. This was just a regular school sized backback, so this is a word of caution to anyone thinking of stuffing a backpack and thinking of getting away for a weekend with just a personal item. Leaving Vegas to return back to Hamilton is where I encountered my first issue (and probably only issue on this trip). Immediately at the check in counter I noticed that they had people aside (5-6 others) which they had marked as having bags too big to count as personal items. I was told that my backpack was too big and that I too, would have to pay to either have it checked or carry it on board (both fees were in the $75+ range). This is a word of caution to anyone thinking of getting away with it. Pay for the bag or make sure you have a small backpack and can make it work. They gave me a break this time, but based on all the other reviewers here it is very apparent that this is not the case most of the time. Wifi was slow on the flight, the menu surprisingly didn't even have cold sandwiches available, however, snacks and drinks are very reasonably priced ($5-$7 for beers or spirits, most snacks in the $3-$6 range). The aircrafts are all relatively new ex-WestJet B737-800 series planes and in both instances during my flights were clean planes. Cabin crew staff were pleasant and were helpful with whatever issues people had around me. Overall, you get what you pay for. In my case, if I am paying for my flights out of pocket I will definitely consider these guys again. I saved at least $200 Canadian with them for my round trip. Final words - measure your bags and don't take your chances. I got away with it this time but I will most definitely pay for a bag ahead of time on my next flights with them at the time of booking.",4,5,swoop,you get what you pay for,Solo Leisure,Trip Verified,5,3,03dbb92d-b5e2-445f-b271-e08dffdfe36d,Boeing,Las Vegas,Hamilton,1,0,0

She was willing to fly without her luggage in order to make the flight with us so she left her luggage with her husband and went through security and customs to the gate. We were told upon boarding that she would be let on by the flight attendants.

The seats barely recline. Maybe 4 inches, so don't expect to sleep. The extra room was great as we had one child sleep on two seats, and the other on the floor. Thankfully it was a smooth flight so no seat belt lights came on. We had regular seats on the way back and its much more cramped. But not as bad as Air Canada Rouge. Do not waste your money on the onboard internet. It is incredibly slow. Basically makes old dial up seem fast. You can't load Youtube or Netflix. Its only good for light browsing and email (if that). I did complain about this to the service provider and they refunded me. Its quite expensive too. $12 for 90 minutes. Make sure to download the Swoop app before coming to the airport though. Its the only way to access internet. There are no shows or movies available so you need to download these to a phone or tablet before hand. You can access swoopstream.com while in flight to see remaining travel time and altitude, but that's about it. Recommend buying food and drink after security then bring it on board. Not a lot of options on the plane. On the way home there was a huge line up at check in/bag drop due to two full flights at the same time. Staff separated the flights and expedited the earlier flight to Abbotsford through. The flight actually left a little early because of this. Staff was friendly and helpful.

I loved the easy access to Hamilton airport, and everything went according to plan. The return trip was another story. Ontario was suffering from a severe ice storm on the day I was to fly home. I decided to cancel my return flight... big mistake. However, the flight was still going, just delayed, so I rebooked on the same flight... at an extra cost of $300.00! When I arrived at Abbotsford airport, I explained the situation to the Swoop attendant, and she refunded the new ticket cost, and I was back in my original seat and all was good. Although the plane was delayed, I was able to board and prepare to return to Hamilton. Moments before take off... I was pulled off the plane, as my name did not appear on the manifest. I was so distraught as I was travelling alone, and I felt stranded and alone. The next plane back to Hamilton was the next night at 10 pm, which meant another full day of waiting, and not returning home until 6 am 2 days later... overnight flight!

I booked a night at a local hotel, and flew out at 8 am the next morning. When I returned home an emotional wreck and exhausted, I decided to pursue a complaint for the cost and emotional stress of this situation. I am not one to complain, but I felt strongly about explaining the situation to Swoop. I was out a lot of money because of the WestJet flight and hotel booking! When I emailed the airline, they apologized to me for THEIR error. Not only did they pay for my WestJet flight home, but they also paid for my hotel!

Flying to Edmonton our flight was already delayed well over an hour. Coming back to Hamilton was a complete nightmare. Around 5:30pm we were notified that our flight was delayed an hour due to inclement weather. This didn't make much sense as the weather in both Edmonton and Hamilton were fine that day, and other flights were leaving as scheduled.

Everywhere in the airport, including lounges, closed at midnight, so nobody was able to eat anything or rest anywhere other than the gate where you could hear very loud construction sounds. Again at the check-in desk we asked why the plane was so delayed and they said that there was freezing rain in Hamilton and the crew was coming from Hamilton.

However, my return to Hamilton on February 6, 2019, was a different story. Ontario was dealing with an ice storm. At 6:30 am I received an email from Swoop that I could cancel my flight, due to the inclement weather. I would receive a complete refund, provided that I sent an email to Swoop. Unfortunately, I decided to be pro active, and cancelled my flight home to Ontario, even though they did not mention that the flight was cancelled or delayed. Thirty minutes later, I realized that the flight back to Ontario was still on schedule. I decided to rebook on the same plane to Hamilton. I was shocked to see that the price had doubled to $449.00 for a one- way ticket (WO106). However, I booked a new seat on the same plane. I rushed to the Abbotsford Airport, and tried to explain to the Swoop attendant that I wanted to cancel the new booking, and keep my original booking for the same flight. The attendant was on the phone for quite awhile, explaining the situation, and she confirmed that I was back on my original plan and that the airline was refunding the $512.00 onto my credit card for the one- way ticket home. I was given a boarding pass, and everything was good. Once through security it was announced at the airport that the plane was delayed 5 hours. Because we were landing in Ontario after 10 pm, I decided to book a night at the Super 8 at $145.77. Finally, we were called to board the plane around 3:00 pm. (original flight time was 10:20 am). Just before take off, an attendant called out my name, and ordered me OFF the plane! I was travelling alone, confused and devastated! The attendant went to the computer and noticed that I was cancelled off of both bookings.The attendant admitted to Swoop’s mistake  and the best they could offer was a booking on the next plane with $100.00 off the new price of $449.00. Unfortunately, the next plane back to Hamilton was on Thursday, February 7 at 10:00 pm, landing on Friday, February 8 at 5:30 AM! I was scheduled to work on Friday! I then decided to find a flight on WestJet that would get me home on Thursday, February 7. The entire trip home cost me an extra $663.02 because of Westjet's one way flight cost ($598.30), another night at a hotel ($136.82), no refund on the cancelled Super 8 Hotel ($145.77), and cab fares,etc. The emotional distress to me because of Swoop's error was huge. Travelling alone, without my luggage, far away from home, was the worst day I had experienced in a very long time. I know the risk in travelling during the winter months, but the communication within Swoop about delays, was unacceptable. They knew that the flight to Ontario was delayed, yet waited until I was sitting in the airport, already checked in, to announce it? I would have never cancelled my original flight, if I knew that it might not be cancelled? Even though I enjoyed the lower cost of flight and the convenience of a direct flight to B.C., I was devastated by the experience getting home.

After boarding, we were held onboard over 3 hours after we were otherwise ready to push back. This isn't clear violation to Swoop's tariff for international flights, which calls for taking passengers off the plane after 2 hours, and offering food and drink after 90 minutes. We were held on board over three hours and refused food and drink. This was after having the flight delayed for more than two hours earlier in the day because the crew needed rest. Ultimately, we are all pulled off the plane and had to wait another hour or so until somebody in Calgary decided whether or not to cancel the flight. Weather conditions ultimately led to the flight, and three other Swoop flights trying to leave Hamilton at the same time. Of course, none of us can control the weather, but an airline can control the customer service it offers its passengers. This is where Swoop failed so miserably. Swoop ground staff had no idea how to handle the situation in front of them effectively. They gave conflicting information. They behaved rudely. they clearly couldn't care less about the individuals involved and the impact it was having on them. Yes, people were upset, but their vacation plans had just been ruined. For the folks working at the airport, this is just their job. Provide customer service and do it well. Well, they didn't do that. on the plane, the flight crew advised us to contact swoops customer service department in Calgary. Of course, anybody who tried to do so immediately learned that Swift customer service in Calgary was closed. Since the cancellation, it has just been a continued serious of frustrations trying to contact and get any kind of satisfaction out of swoop. It might look like you're saving money when you see the Swoop price, but to my mind, it isn't worth the hassle. Don't let them ruin your vacation.

My flight was at 7:45AM on December 27th in Edmonton, I have already checked into my flight the night before at 9PM and I had been running late to the airport due to my morning sickness, I had upgraded my seats to the front of the plane when I had checked in in case my morning sickness continued onto the flight. When I have arrived at the airport and gotten up to the counter to check my bag which I PAID for and get a hard copy of my check in tickets the women had denied me entrance of the plane because my baggage was going to make it when it was 6:55AM and my plane was departing at 7:45AM yes I was pushing it close and only had 5 minutes but the women beside me had said to the lady at her customer counter ‘you just made it ‘ Then after trying to find out my options with the lady at the check in desk, she had the nerve to ask why I was late, and I had then told her because I was having morning sickness, which then she had proceeded to say I was not allowed on the plane in general because I was sick. I have never been more disgusted and mistreated by an airplane ever in my life and when I had gone ahead and emailed them about it, and the women at the counter wrote on my profile that I was 13 mins late, that’s when I had walked away from the counter because she spend 13 minutes being rude. They also said I couldn’t wait to get on the 12PM flight because I was sick and it was going to cost me full price. Being nearly $800 dollars for my fiancé and I.

Not only did I receive quick service with friendly staff, it did not take me long to board the plane. The flight was smooth and we got there just in time, if not just a few minutes earlier. Coming back home with fly swoop is the reason why, I’ll fly with them again. I sustain an injury while on vacation and the flight crew was beyond helpful and quick to ensure I was comfortable and able to enjoy my flight. Special thanks to the crew on board my return flight. Now back to the review, the plane is clean and spacious. Yes you have to pay for upgrades, but that’s what you would expect with a discount carrier. Honestly though, I feel you don’t require the extra leg space, I was very comfortable with the room I had. You have a chance to board the plane with food and beverages you can purchase at the food shops located in terminal, Also you can purchase drinks and food in the cabin, they accept visa and credit (visa debit, not sure) Flyswoop has given me the option to take mini vacations throughout my hectic work schedule and hope to see them expand in the North, maybe Anchorage, Whitehorse, or even Yellowknife. Also the South, Port of Spain, Santiago and more. They offered complimentary movies, that you watch on your own devices, this made the trip even quicker! This service is for the smart, trendy, cost savings individual, and everyone else who would rather spend more money on their vacation. Downfalls of flyswoop, they use a smaller international airports which is a bit of a distance to major cities - however, you can rent a car, or catch a bus for a reasonable price.

Got to Hamilton airport and found out there was a delay till 8:20AM , then till 2:00 pm then 3pm. The swoop supervisor at the airport said we would be reimbursed for $30.00 each for meals d/t the delay. As well, when we checked our one suitcase- I was told to call Swoop central support to have them reimburse me for a carry on bag that I accidentally paid for but did not bring. We finally landed in Edmonton at 5:45PM 9 hr delay. When we called ""Swoop Central Support"" which we waited on the telephone for 48 min before someone answered - we told the agent we had 2 things to discuss. Reimbursement for my error in paying for an extra carry on bag - we were advised by the Swoop employee who checked us in to call central support and they would reimburse us for that error)- we were told by Central Support that this was not possible- I accidentally paid for a carry on bag for both flights - I asked if he could just cancel that bag for the return flight (as we were not leaving for a day) He said he would not bcancel the charge for the return flight.($36.75) It was my fault for clicking that button and I agreed to the conditions so there was nothing he would do. I reminded him that the employee in Hamilton that checked us in told us to call this department and they would reimburse us as it was an accident. He said that the employees at the airport are contract workers and she was wrong to have told us that. After much discussion I asked to talk to a supervisor and he refused saying that Swoop does not transfer any calls to a manager/supervisor. He said if I had issues I could put a report into the Canadian Transportation Agency. During this same call we discussed the delay. The same employee started to explain that this delay was not due to Swoops fault- he said that it started on the Sat before the Tuesday flight with mechanical problems and a flight crew who had a ruptured ear drum etc, and that this is what put this flight behind. I asked him why they didn't change their computer check in status then because at 3:40 Tuesday AM the flight was still on time. I cut him off and I told him what the staff in Hamilton told us - it was delayed because the pilot came to work but was unable to fly and so they needed to find a pilot and fly him in and then the rest of the crew would be over there regulated time so they needed to fly them in. He stopped fighting with me then but then said that the $30.00 person coverage for food d/t the delay was only $10.00 per person. Once again I told him we had been told by Swoop staff in Hamilton that it was $30.00 person. He said they made a mistake at the airport for telling us this.

Travellers: Me, my husband and our 3 year old. Bags: Personal item each plus a car seat and a stroller. I found the trip to be seamless. I checked in online but still went to the counter as we originally had our infant on the reservation but decided to leave him at home with Grandma. The check in attendant called the hotline and removed him from the reservation and even refunded me the tax associated with the infant. I was given 2 gate check tags for my car seat and stroller. Personal items were not measured or weighed but we clearly small. If they had wanted me to stuff it into the sizer, I would have had to finagle the backpack and bag in, but it would have fit. Priority boarding for those with small children, that was us. Also smooth. Once on the plane, you could put your jacket and bags in the overhead if you wanted.

Well we were concerned about how our flight would be based on the reviews being mostly really negative. Well we are happy to say that both of our flights were excellent. Both were on time and we had excellent service from the staff at Abbotsford airport as well as Edmonton airport. We also had excellent service from every Swoop employee on both flights. The flight attendants were excellent. It is a shame that people will take the time to post negative comments online yet few will take the time to leave positive ones. It seems like many people sadly just take good service for granted. We have been dedicated WestJet customers for years and the only reason we are now using Swoop to go to Edmonton is that WestJet no longer flies to Edmonton direct from Abbotsford or vice versa. I think that many people are comparing Swoop to WestJet which also has amazing customer service. We need to realize that Swoop is new and if we think back to when WestJet first started up we will remember that WestJet had many issue when they first opened up. Look at how amazing WestJet turned out to be! Based on our two trips we are confident that Swoop will become as good as WestJet has and with time Swoop will work out some of the issues that are brought to their attention. Again from our two trips we have nothing but positive things to say about Swoop and their staff. Keep up the great work and please know there are many of us out here that think you are doing a great job and that we understand that with time you will even get better. People also need to keep in mind that there are somethings that no airline company has control of. Many of the negative comments on this site are about a flight out of Abbotsford that was delayed till the next day. People were upset that Swoop would not pay their 150 dollar hotel cost. They left out that the plane that was coming into Abbotsford from Edmonton was stuck by lightening and and was deemed to be unsafe to fly until a full inspection of the plane was done. Not putting in all the facts when doing a review is not right. Also we understand and feel for those that had to get hotels that missed their flights but to expect to have Swoop or any other airline pay for a 150 dollar a night hotel when the flight to Edmonton was 9 yes 9 dollars is unrealistic. 9 dollar to Edmonton and 26 dollars from Edmonton back to Abbotsord is unreal!,5,5,swoop,both of our flights were excellent,Couple Leisure,Trip Verified,5,0,0df41907-009e-4259-8aef-b320fbadcd3e,Boeing,Abbotsford,Edmonton,1,1,1

If you want to rate Swoop airlines, you have to consider it to be a no-frills airline. Comparing it to Air Canada or Westjet is not appropriate, a more realistic comparison would be Ryanair. As a it is a no-frills airline, my experience was very positive. Customer service took exceptionally long to answer my call (about 45 minutes) but was able to resolve my issue within minutes afterwards. Hamilton and Abbottsford are small airports, therefore security was done in 10 minutes. Downside: no public transport whatsoever at Abbotsford, prepare to take a taxi to the city center or to be picked up by someone you know. Both flights were on time. The amenities on board are way better than Ryanair. In-seat power, in flight entertainment via wifi and movable neckrests were available at every seat. This is even comparable to Westjet and Air Canada and well beyond low cost carrier standard. However, recline was minimal, so sleeping was not quite possible in this upright position. If you bring a neck cushion it's okay. On board amenities for purchase were limited but reasonable priced. 3.99 for headphones or 4.99 for a bowl of ramen soup are fine in my opinion.

The two of us flew for the first time with Swoop from Abbotsford to Edmonton September 21st and returned September 23rd with absolutely no problems. Considering this is a low cost airline, we knew we’d would have to pay for any extras which is typical for any budget airline. Booking was simple and the cost of add-ons was clear. Prompts for extras could quickly be by-passed if not required. We didn’t pay extra for seat selection as we don’t really mind where we sit on a plane and we were ok if we were not seated together for a short flight. Both times when we checked in manually before arriving at the airports, we were assigned adjacent seats anyways. Clear convenient options were provided at check in to print your boarding pass, download it, or have it emailed to you. Rules regarding minimal check-in time, baggage check-in, boarding time, restrictions, in-flight costs etc were very clear and repeated through-out the process. It was also clear if you were late and missed the minimum check in times, you would not be allowed to board and the plane would not wait for late passengers.  When we arrived at the airport there was no line up, staff was efficient and friendly, and our check in was very quick. Flight was on time, the airplane was clean, and staff nice. An information announcement was made to download the Swoop app for entertainment. (I had already downloaded the app when booking our flight and found it user friendly). We had checked one bag which we retrieved quickly upon arrival and were on our way. Our flight back was a very similar experience. Check-in was quick again with a minimal wait and 4 staff members available. We were pleasantly surprised with the offer of upgraded seats on the emergency exit aisle which had a lot more leg room. Just after we cleared security, we received an email notification advising our flight was delayed 30 minutes which was fine as things happen and our flight boarded and left right on time for the new departure time. Again the plane was clean and the staff friendly. We would definitely fly Swoop again: We got an incredible deal on our flights (even with extras), the booking process was easy and quick, the Swoop app was easy to use, staff was friendly and polite at each part of the journey, flight was good especially with the upgraded seats and extra leg room, baggage arrived promptly and in good shape. Just make sure you read the rules before you book, are ok with the cost of any extras you may require and factor these costs in when price comparing, arrive on time, and follow the company’s rules - this is the same with any other airline.

Our flight was diverted from Hamilton to Toronto due to heavy winds in Hamilton. Once we got to Toronto we were told we were just waiting to get a spot at a gate. This turned into over 2 hours of waiting on the plane. After 2 and a half hours they finally came around with half a small glass of water for everyone. You would think sitting in a hot plane for over 2 hours they would at least give you water, but no, they barely had enough on board to give everyone half a tiny glass. So after almost all customers had now made alternate plans to have family or friends pick them up from Pearson, they announce that we will be attempting fly back to Hamilton. The weather outside had gotten even worst, raining and so windy that the plane was shaking while even on the ground but because they’re too cheap to actually let us off at Pearson so they don’t have to pay to land there, we were heading back into a storm worst than what diverted us in the first place. They would not let anyone exit in Toronto. At this point you have babies screaming, everyone’s hot, thirsty and annoyed and the flight crews response was “we want to go home too and we don’t get paid while on the ground”. They announce that we were waiting to refuel and we would then be back up in the air for our “12 minute flight to Hamilton”. This went on for another hour at least to wait to refuel. Now I know the flight crew can’t control the weather but to not even give water to over 100 people sitting in a recycled air trap is just ridiculous. We eventually made it to Hamilton after about 20 minutes of turbulence the entire flight. They kept repeating that these decisions were being made for “our safety” yet the 15 minute flight was even worst than the original flight when we first attempted to land and diverted. Once on the ground the staff scurried like scared mice and where nowhere to be found. No vouchers for any of the inconvenience of having people drive back and forth from Hamilton to Toronto back to Hamilton to pick up their family and friends. Not even a voucher for a bottle of water. But I guess this shouldn’t be expected when they stock the bare minimum on their flights to begin with and seem cheap with everything. Overall terrible experience and would not recommend this airline. It may be ok if everything goes completely as planned but the second something goes off course they don’t seem to care at all.

The pilots didn't bother communicating to the passengers at all (except before takeoff). The menu is extremely basic and on the more expensive end. They didn't offer snack options that appealed to us (noodles in a cup? really?) No wonder nobody wanted to purchase anything. One of the more ridiculous onboard rules they have is no complimentary water. There was a group behind me that asked for a water because there child was very thirsty and the crew continued to say no saying it's not included in your fare. The passengers had to pay $4 for water. Another thing I noticed is that they really like to overcharge passengers to pre-pay for their seat. ($45 for an exit-row seat).

Tried several times during the day and could not do. Check in at the terminal was quick, efficient and the staff very friendly. Where the problem arose was at boarding - they had two flights departing at the same terminal at the same time. One to Winnipeg, the other to Edmonton. the girls managing the Winnipeg boarding were really good in announcing where the passengers were to check in, and kept control of the area. This did not happen on the Edmonton boarding. It was a crowd of people all gathered at the stand where they scan your boarding pass. The girls there should have been announcing every few minutes where Edmonton was boarding, when, etc but the choose not to, total chaos. The flight crew was very good, the interior of the plane looked new, seats a little tight but it is a discount airline. We were late taking off and arriving in Edmonton, not happy about that. The landing was really rough, must be a new pilot. The bags though were out in minutes so did appreciate that.

I arrived at the Hamilton airport an hour before departure time but unfortunately no one was at the Swoop counter to take my bag or check me in. I had not checked in earlier as I had trouble doing so on line. At about 35 minutes before the scheduled departure an attendant arrived at the counter. She told me it was too late for her to be able to check me in as they were already boarding. As a result, I was not able to take that flight and had to take a cab to Pearson airport and book with another airlines. Although friendly, the staff representative was not helpful and said she would try to log onto the system, even though, as she said, she knew it wouldn’t work, but would try “to humour me”. There was nothing funny about this. The moral of this message if something seems like too good of a bargain it probably is. I think this airlines is grossly understaffed and not worth the difference in the cost of the other airlines.

A traveller in the group payed for a different flight and flew out Sunday night with a different airline, so her seat was available. However, they wouldn't let me take her seat and told me there was nothing they could do. The group counted 17 empty seats on the ""fully-booked"" flight that I could have taken. All workers we encountered from Swoop were extremely unhelpful and did not even attempt to help us. Delaying a flight for 4 days without any sort of compensation is unacceptable.

The return flight was supposed to be leaving at 6:15pm, September 16th. When we got to the airport no one was at the counter to check our bags so we were forced to go through security with them and have our oversized liquids all thrown out ($30 value). Once we got to our gate the attendant for Swoop told us it would be $84 to check our bags even though we already paid $50 in the first place. After explaining that this is absolutely ridiculous they tagged our bags and said they would put them on the flight. Half an hour later the flight is deemed delayed. Another half an hour later the flight is canceled because apparently the plane had been hit by lightening when it landed. The flight agents said there is nothing they can do and nothing (hotel, transport, or food) will be covered. Unbelievable! So many people and families were left stranded at the Abbotsford airport. We then had to book a hotel for the night ($140) and wait until our rescheduled flight at 8:45am the next morning. Woke up to head to the airport only to receive an email saying this flight has now been canceled and the next flight we could take would be Tuesday the 18th at 6pm. That is 2 days after we are supposed to be home!!! It’s absolutely unbelievable. We went to the airport to see if there were any earlier flights and were just told, “no, our other fights are full and maybe go book a new flight with flair airlines instead”. No help, no reimbursement, nothing. So now we have had to spend money on a hotel, food, transport and additional flights ($400+) just to get home. I have been on hold with swoop customer service for 1.5 hours (still currently am) and have not spoken to anyone.

This resulted in leaving us in Edmonton an additional 3 hours until their next flight landed. Our times were changed twice on the departure flight days before we even left.

I made a reservation for my daughter and me to fly from Abbotsford to Edmonton on Aug 31 to attend a memorial for a friend. When we arrived in Edmonton, my daughter realized that she would not be able to fly back with me on September 2nd. So she went online to the swoop website and cancelled her flight. The wording on the website said ""Cancel flight for H. Johnston? Confirm?"" So she confirmed that was what she wanted. When I returned to the Edmonton airport on Sept. 2nd for the return flight , I was told that my flight was cancelled also and that I would need to rebook for $200+. I tried to explain the website cancellation had been only for my daughter, and not me, but they really didn't care and said it was out of their hands. I argued and asked to see a manager, but to no avail. I am now going into hour 2 of being on hold to try and get some resolution to this issue.. Customer service is pathetic. The agents in Edmonton were terrible, under trained and not the least bit interested in trying to problem solve for a paying customer. They are only capable of looking at a computer screen and reading back what it says. Swoop has lost me as a customer.  I actually waited 2 hours and 5 minutes before being connected with an actual Swoop rep. She said it is impossible to make partial cancellations online. We went round and round until I asked to speak to her manager The manager also insisted that Heather, my daughter must have cancelled both reservations and no matter how much I insisted that the website had said ""Heather J.... confirm cancellation"" she would not acknowledge that this happened. She said partial reservations can only be cancelled by telephoning a customer service representative. I suggested that if every customer who wanted to cancel a partial reservation had to wait 2 hours to actually talk to a person ( as I did today) that perhaps their website and systems needed fixing. She stated they were thinking about changing the system but had not yet done so. She also stated that the reason I had to wait so long today is that they were backlogged with calls because their call centre was closed on Saturday and Sunday! What the hell!! She then covered that tidbit of info by saying that they do have agents who respond to emails 24/7!! So here's what I got from all that. Don't use their website to cancel partial reservations because their system can't handle it.  Instead call them directly(which by the way, they state will cost you $15.00 plus applicable taxes and it may take 2 hours + to get an answer! However once you do call, be aware that the call centre might be closed so you will never get an answer. In that case you will have to email them and I have no idea how long their response to an email might take! Totally laughable! She said she could do nothing for me and when I suggested that she indeed could do something by offering me a refund,as a gesture of good will, for the return ticket plus baggage charges that I had to pay the second time. She refused. She put the icing on the cake for me when she said that she really appreciated my feedback because they would use the info I provided as a coaching opportunity! Unbelievable! .

My family and I flew return from Hamilton to Abbotsford  in August and the experience was flawless. The flight attendants were patient, friendly and helpful. At one point, the attendants began meal/drink service (they announced they'd be doing so) and some passengers kept trying to squeeze by the cart to go to the washroom (everyone should know this is rude and ignorant toward the staff) and the attendants were friendly and would move the cart to the front of the plane so passengers could continue to use the facilities. My only critique is that the meal options were slim (no sandwiches or wraps), they only had snacks available for purchase (hummus, crackers etc.) I think on a longer flights (4+ hours) there should be small meals available for purchase. I also recommend upgrading to the larger seats - I sat in both a regular seat, and an extra leg room seat - for the price, the larger seat is worth it.

I've flown these economy airlines before (like Spirit) and you do get what you pay for. However, I've never seen such a lack of organization, and lack of care. After specifically having a conversation at the check-in counter in Abbotsford, BC about me checking in early for my flight to Hamilton, the attendant seemed very confused. She was instructed by another agent to highlight my bag tag and speak to baggage crew to ensure it did not get put on an earlier flight. Instead, there was a black marker scribble on it when I found it. Luckily my travel partner, who took an earlier flight to Winnipeg, spotted my bag on the baggage carousel when he arrived there. He retrieved it for me and brought it to the attendant there. I spoke to her over the phone and chose the fastest option to get my bag back: It would be on the earliest flight into Hamilton the next day with a rushed/flagged order on it and I would be contacted when it arrived. I opted not to get it shipped to my home in Hamilton based on the lack of competence thus far. I also confirmed with an agent at the Abbotsford airport that I would definitely receive a phone call right when my bag arrived. I was assured this was the case. I received no call at all the next day, and when I tried to call Swoop, waited on hold for 30 minutes without anyone answering the phone. Their phone hours then ended at 4:30 PM on Saturday, so I was unable to even get through to be on hold, and they were closed on Sunday. After speaking to security at the Hamilton airport, I decided to just drive out there at 10 PM that night, since a Swoop flight was arriving. There were no Swoop agents at the front desk. Security directed me to an agent, and I found my bag sitting in the back room with two agents, not locked, and still no phone call to inform me. This Swoop agent also seemed confused, saying she thought this bag was getting shipped off to Edmonton. Thank goodness I went to take matters into my own hands. I'm not sure anyone would have ever called me. Moral of the story: Cheap flights. Lots of promises with no action. Do not check bags with them (which you pay for).

I was prepared with water and snacks as I didn't want to purchase these things on board. I am 6 feet tall, and was expecting the legroom to be lacking, but I was comfortable! I did not upgrade seats. There were a couple of inches between my knees and the seat in front of me. The under-seat space for my personal item was ample. I brought a very large purse and a small backpack for my daughter, both fit with room to spare. The seats were comfortable and roomy. I also noticed that my seat didn't recline, and I don't think it was because it was broken. I didn't see anyone reclining their seats, so I believe this feature was not built into these seats. And I actually prefer it that way, as travelling with young children, they are on your lap and moving quite a bit, and reclining seats take up valuable space. The biggest issue that came up involved our car seat. We checked it in oversized luggage in Edmonton, and it did not make it on to our plane. There was another family in the same situation when we arrived in Hamilton. Swoop offered us replacements for the missing car seat, and boosters for the other family. On the spot, we were issued new in-the-box seats and a follow-up and return of our missing equipment was promised. This situation went from panic, (as it is illegal and unsafe to transport a young child without a car seat, so we were effectively stranded) to a reasonable and fair solution. We were held up for a few minutes while the airline staff wrote out our forms and organized things, but I give Swoop big credit for stepping up and fixing things since, as I mentioned, this was not their fault. I would fly Swoop again. The key to enjoying this airline is knowing your baggage limitations, and being prepared for the no-frills service.",5,5,swoop,I would fly Swoop again,Family Leisure,Trip Verified,5,0,2072eb24-eb9b-4346-bfe7-6654204b239b,Boeing,Edmonton,Hamilton,1,1,1

I am a pregnant 26 year old with a back injury due to a car accident and decided to try and fly with Swoop last week to go visit friends and family. They assured and reassured me over the phone that after I arrived in Edmonton, AB from a different airline they would have someone from their airline to pick me up at my gate with a wheelchair, take me to baggage and back up to the Swoop counter in time to catch my flight. When my plane landed there was no one there to pick me up so the other airline had to deliver me to baggage and then had an information agent take me up to the Swoop counter, where there was no one available to check in my bag. So due to all the misled information I received over the phone by Swoop I ended up missing my flight and was left stranded at the Edmonton airport alone overnight and now the company refuses to take responsibility or honour any type of remuneration to rectify the situation.

I couldn’t call the airline immediately because their call center was already closed and they do not have a 24 hour line of communication. I called the following day and explained my situation only for the employee to tell me that the airline will not issue me any kind of credit or refund because I am changing my flight within 24 hours of booking it and that is their “policy”.

The airplane was new, flight attendants were pleasant and helpful and departure and arrival were on time. Yes you need to pay for your carry on luggage which is comparibly priced to other leading airlines in Canada as long as you buy in advance. I travelled with my three young children aged 7, 5, and 2. Both the flight attendants made sure to introduce themselves prior to the flight and check in frequently to make sure the kids were comfortable throughout the flight. I think people need to be a bit more understanding of a few things: 1. This is a new airline, there are going to be bumps in the road and if you are getting a great price you need to be cognizant of that. 2. There are going to be minor delays and inconvenience, and this happens with all airlines I never experienced any of these problems and was very pleased with my first flight with Swoop airline!",4,5,swoop,pleased with my first flight,Family Leisure,Not Verified,5,3,2c746d54-a09c-47d1-9e01-894d4072230f,Airbus,Hamilton,Abbotsford,1,1,1

I was hesitant to use it, since a lot of the reviews were quite horrible, but after my experience I don't understand where these other people are coming from. First of all, I had no issues getting on board, if you follow the times and rules you will have no issues, as with any other airline. If they say you must check in by a certain time and you don't, and you cannot get on because of that, that is your fault not a problem with the airline. My first flight was delayed by an hour, which wasn't great but these things happen, and we were politely kept informed through everything. They let us know as soon as the delay happened, through the app and through the announcement in the terminal. They updated us when maintenance crew was on their way, when they arrived, when they were completed, and when we could start boarding. It honestly was more information than I would have expected from any airline. I did not pay for extra legroom seating and still found the space adequate, mind you I am not a large or tall person. The space is less than you get from non-discount airlines but not as significant of a difference as I was expecting from the comments. There were people behind me with extra legroom and they commented how good it was, so I believe if you are worried that would be a good option for you. You'd likely still save money even after the extra costs. The seats were not comfortable but not much less than an average flight, I would struggle on a long-haul flight in them (mine was a 2 hour flight) as with any long-haul flight, but for short distances it was fine and again, I think the difference in comfort wasn't much compared to the difference in price. The flight attendants and pilot were some of the friendliest I have experienced from any airline and were incredibly helpful and entertaining, this part especially made the flight seem less budget-oriented. They do nickle-and-dime you for everything, and I paid $30 each way for carry-on luggage, so if you are pricing airlines be sure to account for any of these extra charges you may want added on when you are comparing prices. You also have to pay per hour ($6.49/hour) for the in flight wifi which I didn't know going in, so I just skipped using, but the people beside me connected and streamed movies on their phone without issues. All that being said, I paid less than half of what I would with any other airline. The flight cost was just over $300 there and back and usually the trip would have cost me over $700. This made it so I could actually afford to go see family, so I am very grateful to Swoop for providing this service! If you are truly a traveller on a budget this is a great option! I had zero issues and you likely will too. If you are looking for all the above and beyond comforts, you shouldn't be looking at discount airlines anyways. Of course they charge for every extra, but that means you only pay for what YOU want, it's more like a custom built flight experience. Save money on getting there and have more money for fun at your destination! I will definitely consider flying with Swoop again.",4,5,swoop,budget airline is a great option,Solo Leisure,Trip Verified,5,0,eaf32bae-22d6-4579-a986-21715ebb2e34,Boeing,Hamilton,Winnipeg,1,0,0

Would not even honor ticket to Halifax on next day. My son had to pay for hotel, food and refused to pay for another ticket to Halifax. Booked on Flair instead. Don't fly Swoop, worst treatment ever by an airline in 30 years.",1,1,swoop,worst treatment ever,Solo Leisure,Trip Verified,1,0,5c3cce64-cab6-419c-a9da-e6b31a6dc84c,Airbus,Abbotsford,Halifax via Hamilton,0,0,0
